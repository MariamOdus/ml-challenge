# ðŸŽµ 14 Days of ML: Spotify Music Analysis Challenge

## Overview
This project works as a complete machine learning journey using Spotify music data, exploring and evaluating 13 different machine learning algorithms. The goal is to understand how a wide range of models â€” from simple approaches like linear regression to more advanced methods such as neural networks â€” can be applied to extract insights from music-related features.

Along the way, we will compare the strengths, limitations, and practical suitability of each algorithm for different types of analytical questions, such as predicting song popularity, classifying tracks by genre or mood, and identifying patterns in user listening behavior.

## Dataset
Each Machine learning odel has its own dataset, each can be found in individual implementations or alternatively in the data folder of the project. Below are a compliation of the data sources used.
